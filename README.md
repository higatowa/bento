# Bento Toolkit for PT and CTF

This software is exprimental but we accept suggestions and contributions

_A bento (弁当, bentō) is a single-portion take-out or home-packed meal of Japanese origin._

Bento Toolkit is a simple and minimal docker container for penetration testers and CTF players.

It has the portability of Docker with the addition of X, so you can also run GUI application (like burp).

## Prerequisites
To run bento you need `Docker`  and a `Xorg server` on your host machine.

## Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/higatowa/bento`
- `cd bento && docker build -t bento .`
- generate keypair and put `authorized_keys`, contianing your public key, in `./keys`
- Since we need to fotward X to our machine we need first to get it's ip, and then to execute:
`docker run --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 --user tamago -p 8080:8080 -p 22:22 -it bento`
- Connect via ssh to the docker machine and forward port 6000 (Xorg) with `ssh -R 6000:localhost:6000 tamago@bentoip`
## Current tools and utilities

We don't like [bloated](https://www.kali.org/) [distros](https://www.parrotsec.org/) so we are keeping this container as minimal as possible, adding only tools useful for web and infrastructure PT and CTF but, remember, we are always open to suggestions.

Here is a list of tools and utilities:
`burp suite`, `gobuster`, `seclist`, `odat`, `impacket`, `sqlmap`, `sqlplus`, `mysql-client`, `openvpn`, `bytecode-viewer`.
